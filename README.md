# CECS-343-Capstone-Project

- This repository is for the class project in CECS 343 class, Intro to Software Engineering by professor Phuong Nguyen at California State University, Long Beach

## Project description

> John Nguyen is a small-time landlord: He owns an apartment building with 20 units. He wants you to write a program that will make it easier for him to record data and print reports regarding the finances of the apartment building. If you and John can agree on payment, schedule, and the overall purpose of the program, you've completed the inception part of development process.

> Currently John is recording all the information about his apartment building by hand, in old-fashioned ledger books. He shows you the forms he's currently using. There are four of them:

    The Tenant List
    The Rental Income Record
    The Expense Record
    The Annual Summary
    The Tenant List shows apartment numbers in on column and the corresponding tenant's names in the adjacent columns.

> The Rental Income Record records incoming rent payments. It contains 12 columns, one for each month; and one row for each apartment number. Each time John receives a rental payment from a tenant, he records it in the appropriate row and columns of the Rental Income Record.

> The Expense Record records outgoing payments. It has columns for date, the payee (the company or person to whom John write the check), and the amount being paid. In addition , there's a column where John can specify the budget category to which the payment should be charged. Budget categories include Mortgage, Repairs, Utilities, Taxes, Insurance, and so on. 

> The Annual Report uses data from the Rental Income Record and Expense Record to summarize how much money came in and how much went out during the year. All the rents are summed and the result is displayed. The expenses are summed and displayed by the budget category, which makes it easy to see, for example, how much was spent on repairs during the year. Finally, expenses are subtracted from income to show how much money John made (or lost) during the year.

> John tells you that he wants the program pretty much duplicate what he's currently doing on the paper forms. He wants to be able to enter data about tenants, rents, and expenses, and display the various reports
